In this article, we will learn what is strings in a programming language, how to create them, 
and their uses. Further, we will study various operators to com are strings in python. 
At last, we will study some Python strings comparison in brief along with its python code example and output. 
So, letâ€™s get started!

		What are Strings?

A string is generally a sequence of characters. A character is a simple symbol. 
For example, in 
the English Language, we have 26 characters available. 
The computer system does not understand characters and hence, 
therefore, deal with binary numbers. 
Even though we can see characters on our monitor screens, but internally it is 
stored and manipulated as a combination of 0s and 1s. 
The conversion of characters and the binary number is called encoding, 
and the reverse of this is known as decoding.  
Some of the popular encodings are ASCII and Unicode. In the Python programming 
language, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters.

		Python String Comparison operators
		
In python language, we can compare two strings such as identify whether the two strings are equivalent to each other 
or not, or even which string is greater or smaller than each other. Let us check some of the string comparison operator 
used for this purpose below:
..ch 3

==: This operator checks whether two strings are equal.
!=: This operator checks whether two strings are not equal.
<: This operator checks whether the string on the left side is smaller than the string on the right side.
<=: This operator checks whether the string on the left side is smaller or equal to the string on the right side.
>: This operator checks whether the string on the left side is greater than the string on the right side.
>=: This operator checks whether the string on the left side is greater than the string on the right side.
